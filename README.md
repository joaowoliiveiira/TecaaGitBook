  Introduction to the concept of Excess Structural information in API
  documentation. Here I explain why this is a significant issue and how it
  affects the usability of the API documentation.

# Introduction

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are crucial for modern rapid software development as they provide interfaces to reusable software libraries and frameworks. Effective API documentation is essential for proper API usage and adoption. Good documentation can facilitate API usage, while poor documentation can hinder it significantly.

Research by Treude et al. found that not all API documentation units are equally readable, emphasizing the need for automatic detection of API documentation presentation issues, known as 'documentation smells,' as highlighted by Aghajani et al. Despite this need, there is no existing research on the automatic detection of such smells.

There have been identified five API documentation smells by consulting API documentation literature. Four of these smells—bloated, fragmented, tangled descriptions, and excess structural information—were reported as presentation problems by Uddin and Robillard. The fifth smell, 'Lazy documentation,' refers to inadequate descriptions, such as missing explanations for method parameters.

This Gitbook is dedicated to exploring one of the presentation problems mentioned above, the Excess Structural Information.
